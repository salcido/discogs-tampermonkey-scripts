# discogs-tampermonkey-scripts
Random [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) Scripts I've written for users asking for features that aren't available in Discogs Enhancer.

### How to use them

- Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
- Open the Tampermonkey extension menu and click "Create new script..."
- Copy all of the code from the `discogs-tampermonkey-scripts/scripts/<whatever script you want to use>` and paste it into Tampermonkey.
- From the Tampermonkey Editor page click File > Save.
- Tampermonkey should enable the script automatically but if not, be sure to enable it.
- Go to Discogs and it should run automatically
- If you run into issues ping me in the [Discogs Enhancer group](https://www.discogs.com/group/9136) or shoot me an email
